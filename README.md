Python client, based on [`fastmcp`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), for connecting to MCP servers through multiple protocols, specifically designed to work with integrated language models.

## Overview

This package provides a Python interface to connect to MCP servers in an easy, intuitive, and configurable way. It offers a modular architecture that allows for easy extension of new transfer protocols and language models. Currently includes support for HTTPStream and GPT-4 mini, with expansion capability for more options in the future.

## Installation

To install the MCP client, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install mcp-llm-client
```

## Implemented Models

The client currently supports the following language models:

| Model | Technical Description |
| --- | --- |
| gpt4o-mini | Optimized implementation of the GPT-4 model that provides a balance between computational performance and resource efficiency. This model is specifically designed to operate in environments with memory constraints while maintaining superior predictive quality. |

>🚨 **CRITICAL CONFIGURATION NOTE** Currently, this project only work with `gpt4o-mini` llm model.

## Implemented Transfer Protocols

Protocols for communication with MCP servers:

| Protocol | Status | Technical Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPStream | Implemented | Asynchronous HTTP-based protocol that enables continuous data streaming. Characterized by low memory consumption and real-time processing capability for partial responses. |
| SSE (Server-Sent Events) | Not Implemented | Unidirectional protocol that allows the server to send multiple updated events through a single HTTP connection. Designed specifically for applications requiring real-time updates from the server. |
| stdio | Not Implemented | Standard input/output interface that facilitates direct communication between processes. Will provide a lightweight alternative for local environments and unit testing. |

>🚨 **CRITICAL CONFIGURATION NOTE** Currently, this project only work with `HTTPStream` protocol.

## Future Development Planning

### Pending Language Models

* Integration of additional language models
* Implementation of dynamic model selection system
* Optimization of model loading and management

### Pending Protocols

* Complete implementation of SSE for better real-time event handling
* Development of stdio interface for local environments
* Performance optimization across all protocols

## System Requirements

### Environmental Configuration

* **`.env` file**: The `.env` file contains the authentication credentials necessary for integration with external services. This file must be created in the project root directory with the following format:

    ```env
    # .env
    # OpenAI Authentication
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR OPENAI-API-KEY>
    ```

* **`config.json` file**: The `config.json` file defines the configuration of available MCP servers. It must be created in the project root directory with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
        "mcp_servers": {
            "example_server": {
                "http": "http://0.0.0.0:8000/server/mcp",
                "name": "Example mcp server",
                "description": "A simple example MCP server"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    If you need an MCP server to test the code, you can use [simple-mcp-server](https://github.com/rb58853/simple-mcp-server).

### Dependencies

* `Python = ">=3.11"`
* `openai = "^1.68.2"`
* `fastmcp = "^2.5.2"`

## Usage Example

```python
#main.py
from mcpclient import import open_local_chat
open_local_chat()
```

## Version History

### v0.0.1

* Initial implementation of `ClientLLM` client
* Complete integration of `httpstream` protocol ([fasmcp](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk))
* Connectivity with multiple servers
* Simplified config.json file for connection management
* Efficient processing of multiple simultaneous requests to tools and resources within a single query
* Simple connection without authorization (compatible only with servers that do not require authentication)

### v0.0.4

* Package dependencies are incorporated during its initial installation process.
