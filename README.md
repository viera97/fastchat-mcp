## Overview

This package provides a Python interface to connect to MCP servers in an easy, intuitive, and configurable way. It offers a modular architecture that allows for easy extension of new transfer protocols and language models. Currently includes support for HTTPStream and GPT-4 mini, with expansion capability for more options in the future.

## Installation

To install the MCP client, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install fastchat-mcp
```

## Implemented Models

The client currently supports the following language models:

| Model | Technical Description |
| --- | --- |
| gpt4o-mini | Optimized implementation of the GPT-4 model that provides a balance between computational performance and resource efficiency. This model is specifically designed to operate in environments with memory constraints while maintaining superior predictive quality. |

>🚨 **CRITICAL CONFIGURATION NOTE** Currently, this project only work with `gpt4o-mini` llm model.

## Implemented Transfer Protocols

Protocols for communication with MCP servers:

| Protocol | Status | Technical Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPStream | Implemented | Asynchronous HTTP-based protocol that enables continuous data streaming. Characterized by low memory consumption and real-time processing capability for partial responses. |
| SSE (Server-Sent Events) | Not Implemented | Unidirectional protocol that allows the server to send multiple updated events through a single HTTP connection. Designed specifically for applications requiring real-time updates from the server. |
| stdio | Not Implemented | Standard input/output interface that facilitates direct communication between processes. Will provide a lightweight alternative for local environments and unit testing. |

>🚨 **CRITICAL CONFIGURATION NOTE** Currently, this project only work with `HTTPStream` protocol.

## Future Development Planning

### Pending Language Models

* Integration of additional language models
* Implementation of dynamic model selection system
* Optimization of model loading and management

### Pending Protocols

* Complete implementation of SSE for better real-time event handling
* Development of stdio interface for local environments
* Performance optimization across all protocols

## System Requirements

### Environmental Configuration

* **`.env` file**: The `.env` file contains the authentication credentials necessary for integration with external services. This file must be created in the project root directory with the following format:

    ```env
    # .env
    # OpenAI Authentication
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR OPENAI-API-KEY>
    ```

* **`config.json` file**: The `config.json` file defines the configuration of available MCP servers. It must be created in the project root directory with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
        "app_name": "fastchat-mcp",
        "mcp_servers": {
            "example_public_server": {
                "transport": "httpstream",
                "httpstream-url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/public-example-server/mcp",
                "name": "example-public-server",
                "description": "Example public server."
            },
            "example_private_mcp": {
                "transport": "httpstream",
                "httpstream-url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/private-example-server/mcp",
                "name": "example-private-server",
                "description": "Example private server with oauth required.",
                "auth": {
                    "required": true,
                    "post_body": {
                        "username": "user",
                        "password": "password"
                    }
                }
            },
            "github": {
                "transport": "httpstream",
                "httpstream-url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp",
                "name": "github",
                "description": "This server specializes in github operations.",
                "auth": {
                    "required": false,
                    "post_body": null
                },
                "headers": {
                    "Authorization": "Bearer {access_token}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    If you need an MCP server to test the code, you can use [simple-mcp-server](https://github.com/rb58853/simple-mcp-server).

### Dependencies

* `Python = ">=3.11"`
* `openai = "^1.68.2"`
* `mcp[cli]`
* `mcp-oauth`

## Usage Example

```python
#example1.py
from fastchat import open_local_chat
open_local_chat()
```

```python
#example2.py
from fastchat import Chat
chat: Chat = Chat()
while True:
    query = input("> ")
    if query == "":
        break
    for step in chat(query):
        print(f"<< {step.json}")
```

Alternatively, you may test this service using the following [template available on GitHub](https://github.com/rb58853/template_mcp_llm_client):

```shell
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/rb58853/template_mcp_llm_client.git

# change to project dir
cd template_mcp_llm_client

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# open in vscode
code .
```

## Version History

### Last Version Features
