# Cleanup Implementation Changes - English Documentation

## Overview
This document describes all the changes made to implement proper resource cleanup functionality in the fastchat-mcp project. The implementation ensures that all MCP server connections (HTTP/WebSocket and stdio/subprocess) are properly closed to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Fastchat Class (`src/fastchat/app/chat/chat.py`)**

#### New Methods Added:

**`async def close(self) -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Properly cleanup and close the Fastchat instance
- **What it does**:
  - Closes MCP client manager and all its connections
  - Clears all reference collections to help garbage collection
  - Sets client manager to None to prevent further usage
- **Usage**: Call when chat session is no longer needed

**`async def __aenter__(self):`**
- **Purpose**: Context manager entry point for automatic resource management
- **What it does**: Automatically initializes the Fastchat instance when entering an `async with` block
- **Returns**: The initialized Fastchat instance

**`async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):`**
- **Purpose**: Context manager exit point for automatic resource management
- **What it does**: Automatically calls `close()` when exiting an `async with` block, ensuring proper cleanup even if an exception occurs

#### Usage Patterns:
```python
# Manual cleanup
chat = Fastchat()
await chat.initialize()
try:
    # Use chat...
finally:
    await chat.close()

# Automatic cleanup (recommended)
async with Fastchat() as chat:
    # Use chat...
# Automatically cleaned up
```

### 2. **ClientManagerMCP Class (`src/fastchat/app/mcp_manager/client.py`)**

#### New Methods Added:

**`async def close(self) -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Properly close all MCP server connections and cleanup resources
- **What it does**:
  1. Closes all HTTP stream sessions (WebSocket/HTTP connections)
  2. Closes all stdio sessions (subprocess connections)
  3. Clears all cached tools, resources, and prompts
  4. Clears internal service and prompt context lists
  5. Resets singleton instance to None

**`async def __close_all_sessions(self) -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Close all active sessions with MCP servers
- **What it does**:
  - Iterates through all configured MCP servers
  - Calls appropriate close_session function based on protocol type
  - Handles both 'httpstream' and 'stdio' protocols
  - Logs success/error messages for each server

**`async def __aenter__(self):`** and **`async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):`**
- **Purpose**: Context manager support for automatic resource management
- **Usage**: Enables `async with ClientManagerMCP() as manager:` pattern

### 3. **HTTP Stream Sessions (`src/fastchat/app/mcp_manager/sessions/httpstrem.py`)**

#### Major Changes:

**Global Session Tracking:**
```python
# NEW: Global dictionary to store active sessions for proper cleanup
_active_sessions: dict[str, tuple] = {}
```

**Modified `async_get_session()` Function:**
- **Before**: Used context managers that closed connections immediately
- **After**: Manually manages connection lifecycle for later cleanup
- **Changes**:
  - Stores session references in `_active_sessions` for tracking
  - Includes session key in returned data for cleanup identification
  - Calls cleanup immediately on error to prevent resource leaks

#### New Functions Added:

**`async def close_session(server: dict) -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Close HTTP/WebSocket connections for a specific MCP server
- **What it does**: Reconstructs session key from server config and calls `close_session_by_key`

**`async def close_session_by_key(session_key: str) -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Performs actual cleanup of HTTP/WebSocket connections
- **What it does**:
  - Properly closes session using `__aexit__` method
  - Properly closes connection using `__aexit__` method
  - Removes session from active sessions tracking
  - Ignores cleanup errors to prevent cascading failures

**`async def close_all_sessions() -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Close all currently active HTTP/WebSocket sessions
- **Usage**: Useful for complete cleanup when shutting down

### 4. **Stdio Sessions (`src/fastchat/app/mcp_manager/sessions/stdio.py`)**

#### Major Changes:

**Global Session Tracking:**
```python
# NEW: Global dictionary to store active stdio sessions for proper cleanup
_active_sessions: dict[str, tuple] = {}
```

**Modified `async_get_session()` Function:**
- **Before**: Used context managers that closed subprocess connections immediately
- **After**: Manually manages subprocess lifecycle for later cleanup
- **Changes**:
  - Stores session references in `_active_sessions` for tracking
  - Includes session key in returned data for cleanup identification
  - Calls cleanup immediately on error to prevent resource leaks

#### New Functions Added:

**`async def close_session(server: dict) -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Close subprocess connections for a specific MCP server
- **What it does**: Reconstructs session key from server config and calls `close_session_by_key`

**`async def close_session_by_key(session_key: str) -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Performs actual cleanup of subprocess connections
- **What it does**:
  - Properly closes session using `__aexit__` method
  - Properly closes stdio connection (terminates subprocess)
  - Removes session from active sessions tracking
  - Ignores cleanup errors to prevent cascading failures

**`async def close_all_sessions() -> None:`**
- **Purpose**: Close all currently active subprocess sessions
- **Usage**: Useful for complete cleanup when shutting down

## Resources That Are Now Properly Cleaned Up

### 1. **HTTP/WebSocket Connections**
- Persistent HTTP connections to MCP servers
- WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- OAuth authentication tokens and sessions
- HTTP client connection pools

### 2. **Subprocess Connections**
- Child processes spawned for stdio MCP servers
- Stdin/stdout/stderr pipes to subprocesses
- Process handles and resources
- Inter-process communication streams

### 3. **Memory Resources**
- Cached tools, resources, and prompts dictionaries
- Service and prompt context lists
- Message sets and conversation history
- Reference cycles that could prevent garbage collection

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. **Prevents Resource Leaks**
- No more hanging HTTP connections
- No more zombie subprocess processes
- No more accumulated memory usage over time

### 2. **Graceful Shutdown**
- All connections properly terminated
- Clean exit even when exceptions occur
- Proper cleanup in both manual and automatic modes

### 3. **Production Ready**
- Safe for long-running applications
- Handles multiple concurrent instances
- Robust error handling during cleanup

### 4. **Developer Friendly**
- Context manager support for automatic cleanup
- Clear separation between manual and automatic cleanup
- Comprehensive logging of cleanup operations

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

- **Structure Tests**: Verify all cleanup methods exist
- **Functionality Tests**: Test actual cleanup behavior
- **Context Manager Tests**: Verify automatic cleanup works
- **Error Handling Tests**: Ensure cleanup works even with errors
- **Integration Tests**: Test full lifecycle with real connections

## Usage Recommendations

### For Production Applications:
```python
# Always use context managers for automatic cleanup
async with Fastchat() as chat:
    # Your application logic
    pass
# Resources automatically cleaned up
```

### For Development/Testing:
```python
# Manual cleanup when you need more control
chat = Fastchat()
try:
    await chat.initialize()
    # Your testing logic
finally:
    await chat.close()  # Always ensure cleanup
```

### For Multiple Instances:
```python
# Each instance is independently managed
async with Fastchat() as chat1:
    async with Fastchat() as chat2:
        # Both instances properly cleaned up
        pass
```

This cleanup implementation ensures the fastchat-mcp project is robust, production-ready, and prevents the common issues of resource leaks that can occur in long-running applications with persistent connections.
